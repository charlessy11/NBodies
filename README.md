The **n-body problem** is the problem of taking the initial positions and velocities of “​n​” celestial bodies and predicting their subsequent positions and motions using Newtonian laws of motion and gravity. Where “​n”​ is greater than 2, no closed-form solution exists to this problem, so a simulation (or something similar) is required to predict the precise positions of the celestial bodies in question.
